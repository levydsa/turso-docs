## Installing

Install the package to your project using composer:

```console
composer require turso/libsql
```

## Initializing

Make sure to add `use Libsql\Database` to access the `Database` object.


```php
$db = new Database("local.db")
```

## In-Memory Databases

libSQL supports connecting to [in-memory
databases](https://www.sqlite.org/inmemorydb.html) for cases where you don't
require persistence:

```php
$db = new Database(":memory:");
```

Or the simpler:

```php
$db = new Database();
```

## Local Development

You can work locally by passing a path as the first parameter.

```php
$db = new Database("local.db")
```

Or more explicitly:

```php
$db = new Database(path: "local.db")
```

## Remote Only

You can use a remote only database by passing `url` and `authToken`.

```php
$db = new Database(
    url: getenv('TURSO_URL'),
    authToken: getenv('TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN'),
);
```

## Embedded Replicas

You can work with embedded replicas by passing a `path`, `url` and `authToken`.
Embedded replicas can sync from the remote URL and delegate writes to the
remote primary database:

```php
$db = new Database(
    path: 'test.db',
    url: getenv('TURSO_URL'),
    authToken: getenv('TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN'),
);
```

### Sync Interval

The `sync_interval` function allows you to set an interval for automatic synchronization of the database in the background:

```php
$db = new Database(
    path: 'test.db',
    url: getenv('TURSO_URL'),
    authToken: getenv('TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN'),
    syncInterval: 300, // Sync every 3 seconds
);
```

### Manual Sync

The `sync` function allows you to sync manually the local database with the
remote counterpart:

```php
$db->sync()
```

### Read Your Own Writes

The `readYourWrites` parameter configures the database connection to ensure
that writes are immediately visible to subsequent read operations initiated by
the same connection. This is **enabled by default**, and is particularly
important in distributed systems to ensure consistency from the perspective of
the writing process.

You can disable this behavior by passing `false`:

```php
$db = new Database(
    path: 'test.db',
    url: getenv('TURSO_URL'),
    authToken: getenv('TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN'),
    readYourWrites: false,
);
```

## Simple query

You can acquire a connection from a database and call `query()` to invoke a
SQL statement, as well as optional arguments:

<CodeGroup>

```php Query
$rows = $conn->query("SELECT * FROM users");
```

```php Arguments
$rows = $conn->query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?1", [1]);
```

```php Named Arguments
$rows = $conn->query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :id", [":id" => 1]);
```

</CodeGroup>

## Prepared Statements

You can prepare a cached statement using `prepare()`, bind parameters, and then
query it:

```php
$stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM users where id = ?");
$rows = $stmt->bind([1])->query();
```

## Placeholders

libSQL supports the use of positional and named placeholders within SQL statements:

<CodeGroup>

```rust Positional
conn->query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", [1]);
```

```rust Named
conn->execute("INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES (:name)", [ ":name" => "Iku" ]);
```

</CodeGroup>

## Batch Transactions

A batch consists of multiple SQL statements executed sequentially within an
implicit transaction. The backend handles the transaction: success commits all
changes, while any failure results in a full rollback with no modifications.

```php
$conn->execute_batch("
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL
  );

  INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('Alice');
  INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('Bob');
");
```

## Interactive Transactions

Interactive transactions in SQLite ensure the consistency of a series of read
and write operations within a transaction's scope. These transactions give you
control over when to commit or roll back changes, isolating them from other
client activity.

```php
$tx = conn->transaction();

$tx->execute("INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES (?1)", ["Iku"]);
$tx->execute("INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES (?1)", ["Iku 2"]);

tx->commit(); // or, $tx->rollback()
```
